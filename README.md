# Goblin Kabobblin'

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

Code For A Cause Mini Jam, 23 May 2025, theme "YOU ONLY GET ONE".

The basic idea:
- 2d single-screen platformer. Win each level by killing all the goblins with your bow.
- Arrows keep moving until they reach the wall, possibly collecting goblins along the way.
- You only get one arrow.
- So arrange for the goblins to line themselves up, then fire.

## Agenda

- Friday
- - [x] Basic app features: Modal, sprite, map, etc.
- - [x] Provisional graphics: Terrain, hero, goblin, arrow
- - - Let's try 8-pixel tiles instead of 16, go for a real lo-fi Atari kind of look.
- - [ ] Core gameplay
- - - [x] Walk, jump, etc
- - - [x] Fire arrows (yes, plural, while developing)
- - - [ ] Goblins
- - - [ ] Hazards: Goblins, pits, fires, timed things like flamethrowers or hammers
- - - [x] Victory and failure conditions
- - - [ ] Moveable blocks, for influencing goblins' movement.
- - [ ] Coyote time.
- - [ ] By EOD: Game should be basically playable. No audio or menus, and temporary layouts.
- Saturday
- - [ ] Maps. 10..20 would be good.
- - [ ] Real graphics.
- - [ ] Sound effects.
- - [ ] Music.
- - - [ ] Play
- - - [ ] Hello
- - - [ ] Denouement
- - [ ] Modals.
- - - [ ] Hello. Do a combined hello/gameover like Dot's Wicked Garden, I liked that.
- - - [ ] Scene Denouement, and find a more concise name for that.
- - [ ] By EOD: Try to be completely finished with the game. So we can see it fresh tomorrow for second-guessing.
- Sunday
- - [ ] Finish game by 1700. That's plenty of overflow time if needed.
- - [ ] Finish Itch page by 2200, test, etc.
- - [ ] Jam closes at midnight.
